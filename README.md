Aastitwa

A Hackathon Project on Unpaid Care Work
Aastitwa (अस्तित्व — Existence / Identity) is a digital platform designed to recognize, quantify, and value unpaid care work. The project addresses the systemic invisibility of care activities such as household labor, childcare, elder care, and emotional support—work that is essential to society yet largely uncompensated and unrecognized, particularly for women.
Aastitwa converts unpaid care contributions into measurable value, enabling caregivers to gain recognition, skill access, and economic opportunities.
